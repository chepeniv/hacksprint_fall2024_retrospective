# Tourist Simulator

given the prompt, travel, we came up with the idea to create a
simulator of what being a tourist trapped in a foreign city is like without
actually having to leave the comfort of one's own home and for much less the
cost -- an experience complete with disappointment and unpleasant interactions

## Background

hacksprint, one-word theme prompt, software engineering school, group project

malik - story elements, theming, asset library, presentation, readme, and slides
michael - maze gen algorithm research, presentation
chepe - front end website logic, back end server, maze gen algorithm, and maze
data handling

## Description

a maze game based on the plot that through some unfortunate happenstance you
find yourself damn-near out of cash and with your essential belongings missing.
as your vacation time rapidly evaporates, you frantically run around lost trying
to somehow gather enough cash to buy yourself a plane ticket back home.

## Experience

### beginning

drawing inspirations, brainstorming kinds of projects, laying out the structure,
planning out our schedules, delegating responsibilities

### middle

late night coding, partners out of town / on the road, busy with work,
taking over other's responsibilities, fixing issues, reliance, having to
dramatically restructure the project

enjoyed putting together the website structure, setting up the core css classes,
building the interactive logic, and creating the algorithms to handle the maze

getting swamped

hunting down bugs wasn't that bad

### end

interacting with peers, instructors, the audience

putting together a last minute presentation without any planed monologue

the unexpected interest others had and their positive reception to my work

having to give a post presentation talk about the algorithm itself

the relief of it being over

## Challenges

what the mvp was ultimately going to be
from my perspective
restructuring and refactoring
people don't have enough time seemingly -- my sleep schedule
technical and collaborative
expectations, unforeseen issues
css issues, having to use flask, technical idiosyncrasies

## Technical

%% tools

standard html, css, jquery, json, flask, and pretty much vanilla python

the front end
drawing a maze
generating a maze

## End Result

given the limited time allotted what we ultimately were able to produce was an
abstract core game which is basic and functional enough to serve as a foundation
for others to build their own maze games over

### Demo / Experience

## Lessons

a browsers role between a user's machine and a server
how a website has to be put together to fit the constraints given
how to generate a random maze, encode it, decode it, and draw it
